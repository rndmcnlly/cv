    \textbf{Dissertation Research}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Area: Artificial Intelligence
        \item Keywords: machine creativity, discovery systems, game design
        \item Statement: My research explores the intersection of machine creativity (which traditionally focuses on aesthetic artifact generation), discovery systems (which traditionally automate the scientific or mathematical discovery processes), and game design (which is traditionally carried out by particularly creative humans), with the aim of producing a systems that creatively discovers game design knowledge through experience (popping out sweet games along the way). Provocative, yeah?
