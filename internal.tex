\section*{Language Paradigms}
For each area, I have used one or more languages in a non-trivial project and
would feel comfortable implementing a simple new language in this area
(including a minimal parser, name resolver, type checker, type inference, code
emitter, interpreter, and/or garbage collector as needed).

\begin{itemize}
  \item functional (static/dynamic/meta) 
  \item logical (static/dynamic/meta)
  \item object-oriented (static/dynamic)
  \item imperative (static/dynamic/meta)
  \item trendy-scripting (dynamic/meta)
  \item assembly (stack/register)
  \item patcher
  \item mathematical (numeric/symbolic)
  \item build (declarative/procedural)
  \item parser (LL-$k$/LALR-$k$/Packrat)
  \item data (various)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Development Settings}
For each area, I have developed multiple non-trivial projects in this setting before.
\begin{itemize}
  \item enterprise (with technical writing)
  \item educational (base-code for student assignments)
  \item research
  \item casual hacking (in groups and alone)
  \item live demo
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Well-developed Personal Interests}
\begin{itemize}
  \item hacker culture
  \item learning programming languages and language implementation techniques
  \item livecoding (writing code, live, while it is running, while the audience watches)
  \item experimental electronic music (both analysis/synthesis)
  \item procedural art (writing code that makes art)
  \item mathematics (probability theory, differential geometry, chaos theory)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Selected Musical Compositions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 3po-demo.pd (a livecoded bangin' trance piece in PureData)
  \item soundless music (an experiment in composing without listening)
  \item bilingualism (a livecoding session where a synthesizer and composer module were developed simultaneously using PureData and Impromptu)
  \item endless claims (a procedural music piece involving generation and performance of random lyrics via text-to-speech library, later reimplemented using web technologies)
  \item idm.ck (a infinite stream of super-gritty intelligent dance music, generated from the sample-level upwards in ChucK) 
  \item /music/reason (25+ full-length tracks and countless loops of original, synth-heavy, experimental electronic music created with Reason) 
  \item /music/hardware (a sampling of experimentations with various pieces of electronic music hardware)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Selected Visual Compositions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item i5 (an interactive iterated function system animation using html5/javascript)
  \item blurry\_maps (a web service that provides a front end for Google Maps which tastefully reinterprets the original map tiles)
  \item boxen (a series of path-traced procedural cube sculptures, printed and framed)
  \item codepoem (a series of abstract, concrete code poems juxtaposing code for a context-free design grammar with one of its visual compositions)
  \item spraw (an artistic mis-application of lossy image codecs to wavelet-encoded images)
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection*{Selected Recreational Projects}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ethereal Dialpad (an interactive synthesizer toy for Android using custom DSP codes)
  \item Iteration (a generative art app for Android using iterated function systems)
  \item Sinistrum (a three-player strategic videogame with multiple levels of deception)
  \item cfml (a unique context-free programming language for livecoding music)
  \item regexio.com (regular expression debugging tool generates example matches)
  \item invisible hand (prototype for document camera system that automatically ignores foreground objects)
  \item the.cubing.game (a physics-based videogame with original art, sound effects, and music)
  \item slut-o-meter (SafeSearch reporting gimmick)
  \item AjaxWar (distributed, multi-player,  real-time strategy game made using only javascript on web client before AJAXy support libraries existed)
  \item DriveByCTF (real-life wardriving game with centralized scoring through the web)
  \item RadAudio (wavelet based audio codec with psychoacoustic modeling)
  \item markov.lisp (instant messaging log re-synthesizer)
  \item katamari.lisp (prototype for text adventure remake of the popular Katamari Damacy)
  \item Project Cicada (WiFi reporting tool using DNS for clandestine upstream data transport)
\end{itemize}
