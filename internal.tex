\section*{Language Paradigms}
For each area, I have used one or more languages in a non-trivial project and
would feel comfortable implementing a simple new language in this area
(including a parser, name resolver, type checker, type inference, code
emitter, interpreter, and/or garbage collector as needed).

\begin{itemize}
  \item functional (static/dynamic/meta) 
  \item logical (static/dynamic/meta)
  \item object-oriented (static/dynamic)
  \item imperative (static/dynamic/meta)
  \item trendy-scripting (dynamic/meta)
  \item assembly (stack/register)
  \item patcher
  \item mathematical (numeric/symbolic)
  \item build (declarative/procedural)
  \item parser (flex-bison/combinator)
  \item data (various)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Development Settings}
For each area, I have developed multiple non-trivial projects in this setting before.
\begin{itemize}
  \item enterprise
  \item research
  \item hacking
  \item live demo
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Well-developed Personal Interests}
\begin{itemize}
  \item hacker culture
  \item recreational academic reading in mathematics and physics 
  \item learning programming languages and language implementation techniques
  \item livecoding (writing code, live, while it is running, while the audience
watches)
  \item experimental electronic music (both analysis/synthesis)
  \item procedural art (writing code that makes art)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Selected Recreational Projects}
\begin{itemize}
  \item invisible hand (prototype for document camera system that removes foreground objects from scene to improve readability)
  \item the.cubing.game (simple video game based on realistic physical simulation with original art, sound effects, and music)
  \item slut-o-meter (SafeSearch reporting gimmick)
  \item AjaxWar (distributed, multi-player,  real-time strategy game made using only javascript on web client before AJAXy support libraries existed)
  \item DriveByCTF (real-life wardriving game with centralized scoring through the web)
  \item spammer.pl (automation of laptop in wardriving game)
  \item GoGetter (javascript-based web crawler and collage generator)
  \item GifGif (a steganographic image codec)
  \item RadAudio (wavelet based audio codec with psychoacoustic modeling)
  \item markov.lisp (instant messaging log re-synthesizer)
  \item katamari.lisp (prototype for text adventure remake of the popular Katamari Damacy)
  \item POSIX Monkey Puncher (thread programming tutorial that is also silly game)
  \item Winter (music visualizer created at informal demo-party)
  \item Project Cicada (WiFi reporting tool using DNS for clandestine upstream data transport)
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Selected Musical Compositions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item soundless music (an experiment in composing without listening)
  \item bilingualism (a livecoding session where a synthesizer and
composer module were developed simultaneously using PureData and Impromptu)
  \item endless claims (a procedural music piece involving generation and
performance of random lyrics via text-to-speech library)
  \item idm.ck (a infinite stream of super-gritty intelligent dance music,
generated sample-by-sample in ChucK) 
  \item /music/reason (25+ full-length tracks and countless loops of
original, synth-heavy, experimental electronic music created with Reason) 
  \item /music/hardware (a sampling of experimentations with various pieces of
electronic music hardware)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Selected Visual Compositions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item blurry\_earth (a scalable web service that provides a front end for Google Maps which tastefully reinterprets
the original map tiles)
  \item boxen (a series of path-traced procedural cube sculptures, printed and
framed)
  \item codepoem (a series of abstract, concrete code poems juxtaposing code for a context-free design grammar with one of its visual compositions)
  \item spraw (an artistic mis-application of lossy image codecs to
wavelet-encoded images)
\end{itemize}
